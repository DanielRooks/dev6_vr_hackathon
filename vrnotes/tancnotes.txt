But let's see if we get that far
So right now top idea just so everyone is onboard
Is robot with a 360 camera on it live streaming to VR headset
The VR controller should control the robot
@Carina Yang
 also suggested a auto explore mode that would work
The upcoming tasks I see is first making sure Ryan is onboarded on how we did the whole communication thing with mqtt
On unity
Then Paige can maybe start looking into unity to Facebook live
For hardware we will make sure Arduino works first
Then we can upgrade to particle board
Once we can input controls
Then we can add other sensors like ultra Sonic sensors to do the whole auto explore thing
If for some magical reason we finish all of this early
We can look into creating a informative overlay on the VR system
So that we can add sensors to the robot
And relay that info to the robot
Also if we magically finish all of thet
That
I got a robot arm we can strap on to the car
So plenty of extra work
I only expect us to get robot car and camera
